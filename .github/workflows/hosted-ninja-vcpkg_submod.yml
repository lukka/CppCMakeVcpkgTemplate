# The peculiarity of this workflow is that assumes vcpkg stored as a submodule of this repository.
# The workflow runs on x64 and ARM platforms.
# Workflow steps:
# - Setup vcpkg and cache it on the GitHub Action cloud based cache.
# - Runs CMake with CMakePreset.json using a presest configuration
#   that leverages the vcpkg's toolchain file. This will automatically run vcpkg 
#   to install dependencies described by the vcpkg.json manifest file. 
#   This stage also runs vcpkg with Binary Caching leveraging GitHub Action cache to 
#   store the built packages artifacts, hence it will be a no-op if those are restored 
#   from cache (e.g., already previously built).
# - Finally builds the sources with Ninja, and tests as well.
