# A "pure" GitHub workflow using CMake, Ninja and vcpkg to build a C/C++ codebase.
# It leverages both CMakePresets.json and vcpkg.json.
# It is called "pure workflow" because it is an example which minimizes the usage of
# custom GitHub Actions, but leverages directly the tools that could be easily run on
# your development machines (i.e. CMake, vcpkg, Ninja) to ensure a perfectly identical
# and reproducible local build (on your development machine) and a remote build on
# build agents.
