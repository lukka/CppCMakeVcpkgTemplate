# A "pure" GitHub workflow using CMake, Ninja and vcpkg to build a C/C++ codebase.
# It leverages both CMakePresets.json and vcpkg.json to have consistent build locallly
# and on continuous integration servers (aka build agents).
# It is called "pure workflow" because it is an example which minimizes the usage of
# custom GitHub actions, but leverages directly the tools that could be easily run on
# your development machines (i.e. CMake, vcpkg, Ninja) to ensure a perfectly identical
# and reproducible build locally (on your development machine) and remotely (on build agents).
