This repository contains a `C++` based project template that leverages [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) and [CMake](https://www.cmake.org)'s [CMakePresets.json](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html) to build and test the source code.

Supports `Linux`/`macOS`/`Windows` on `x64` and `arm64`.

Advantages:
 - `CMakePresets.json` allows to run the same build either _locally on your IDE_ and on _GitHub runners_.
 - `vcpkg` greatly helps in pulling and building the needed dependencies (e.g. libraries).

The repository provides also two GitHub workflows to build the project on [GitHub runners](https://github.com/actions/runner). Both build and test the project using `vcpkg` and `CMake`, the only key difference is their implementation.

 - [hosted-pure-workflow.yml](.github/workflows/hosted-pure-workflow.yml): It is a __pure__ workflow which does not use unneded GitHub Actions that cannot run locally on your development machine. On the other hand it is directly using the `CMake`, `Ninja`, `vcpkg` and the `C++` build tools.
-  [hosted-ninja-vcpkg_submod.yml](.github/workflows/hosted-ninja-vcpkg_submod.yml): It is a concise workflow based on the custom GitHub Actions [run-vcpkg](https://github.com/lukka/run-vcpkg) and [run-cmake](https://github.com/lukka/run-cmake) which simplify and shorten the workflow content while adding some goodies like annotation and automatic caching and cache miss fallback strategy.

## Rationale

The main idea of this `C++` project template is to show how to obtain a _perfectly reproducible_ software development process that can be run anywhere without any difference and no surprises, either locally using your preferred tools/IDE, either remotely on build agents typically used for continuous integration.

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Support

The major `C++` IDEs should already support `CMakePresets.json` and require no particular configuration. For example [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [CMake Tools extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) allows you to open the root folder of this repository, and select in the bottom status bar the presets for generating, building and testing the source code, as show in the following image:
